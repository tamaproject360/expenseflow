You are building an Apple Design Award winning mobile app or Google Play Best of mobile app for 2035. This is a premium Personal Finance app. Every pixel matters. Optimized for touch. No desktop-first logic. No generic inputs.

<app_identity>
Name: ExpenseFlow
Tagline: "Track Smarter. Spend Better."
Core Utility: A daily expense tracker that solves the universal pain of inconsistent spending awareness. Users often lose track of where their money goes — ExpenseFlow eliminates that blind spot by making expense logging fast (under 5 seconds), intuitive, and genuinely enjoyable through mature gamification mechanics.
Target User: Millennials & Gen-Z (ages 18–35) — young professionals, freelancers, and students who want to take control of their personal finances without the complexity of traditional budgeting tools.
Vibe: Mature Gamification — Rewarding, Witty & Sophisticated. Think Duolingo's engagement loop meets Monzo's visual elegance. Achievement badges are minimalist, streak counters use bold typography, micro-celebrations are subtle (smooth checkmarks, soft glows — no confetti explosions). Smart copywriting that feels like a personal finance coach, not a children's game. Example tone: "Nice! Budget on track this week 👏" instead of "YEAY you're amazing!! 🎊🎊🎊"
</app_identity>

<design_philosophy>
ExpenseFlow follows a "Sophisticated Play" design philosophy — where every interaction feels rewarding without being childish. The UX is built around three pillars:

1. SPEED-FIRST INPUT: The primary action (logging an expense) must be completable in under 5 seconds. One-thumb operation. No unnecessary steps. The FAB (Floating Action Button) is always within thumb reach.

2. VISUAL MOTIVATION: Financial data is inherently boring — we make it beautiful. Progress bars animate smoothly, charts are colorful and satisfying, and achievements feel earned. Every number tells a visual story.

3. FRICTIONLESS HABIT FORMATION: Streak mechanics, gentle daily nudges, and achievement unlocks create a positive feedback loop that turns expense tracking from a chore into a micro-habit. The app rewards consistency, not perfection.

All layouts respect the Thumb Zone principle — critical actions live in the bottom 60% of the screen. Navigation is always one-handed. No reaching to the top-left for back buttons. Safe area insets are respected on all devices (notch, Dynamic Island, home indicator).
</design_philosophy>

<color_system>
Forget web palettes. This is a mobile-native UI color system designed for Light Mode:

- Canvas (Background): #F8FAFB — Soft off-white, gentle on eyes during extended use, avoids the harshness of pure white
- Surface (Cards/Sheets): #FFFFFF — Pure white for elevated surfaces, creating subtle depth hierarchy
- Emerald Primary: #10B981 — Growth, money, progress. Used ONLY for the main CTA on each screen (FAB, primary button, active tab indicator)
- Amber Accent: #F59E0B — Energetic highlight for badges, streaks, achievements, and secondary actions
- Text Primary: #1A202C — Deep charcoal for maximum readability, never pure black
- Text Secondary: #64748B — Muted slate for labels, captions, and supporting text
- Danger / Over Budget: #EF4444 — Clear but not aggressive red for alerts and overspend warnings
- Success / On Track: #22C55E — Bright green for achievements, completed goals, and positive states
- Border / Divider: #E2E8F0 — Subtle separation lines, barely visible but structurally important

Rule: High contrast for WCAG AA accessibility compliance. Primary Emerald is reserved exclusively for the single most important action on each screen. Amber is the reward color — users subconsciously associate it with achievements and progress.
</color_system>

<typography>
Optimized for small screens and financial data readability:

- Font Family: "Plus Jakarta Sans" — Geometric, modern, highly legible at all sizes. If unavailable, fallback to "Inter", then system sans-serif.
- Headings (H1/H2): Plus Jakarta Sans Bold, 24px/20px, letter-spacing: -0.02em, tight leading (line-height: 1.2). Confident and commanding.
- Body Text: Plus Jakarta Sans Regular, 16px minimum for readability. Line-height: 1.5. Never go below 14px for any readable text.
- Financial Numbers/Amounts: Plus Jakarta Sans SemiBold, tabular-nums (monospaced digits for aligned columns). Large amounts displayed at 28-32px for visual impact on dashboard.
- Labels & Captions: Plus Jakarta Sans Medium, 12px, letter-spacing: 0.02em, uppercase for tab bar labels. Text Secondary color.
- Button Text: Plus Jakarta Sans SemiBold, 16px, centered, with adequate padding (vertical: 16px, horizontal: 24px).
</typography>

<gestures_and_haptics>
The app feels alive under the glass:

- Tap: Immediate visual response — buttons emit a soft glow effect radiating from the touch point. Glow color matches the button color (Emerald glow for primary, Amber glow for secondary). Duration: 150ms.
- Long Press: Context menus for transaction items (Edit, Delete, Duplicate). Triggered at 500ms with a light haptic.
- Swipe Right: Smooth gesture to navigate back (iOS-style edge swipe). Spring physics with damping: 20, stiffness: 90.
- Swipe Left on List Item: Reveal quick-action buttons (Delete in red, Edit in blue).
- Scroll: Deceleration rate "fast", buttery smooth with momentum. Pull-to-refresh with custom Emerald spinner animation.
- Haptics:
  - Light impact: Tab bar switches, toggle changes
  - Medium impact: Expense saved successfully, budget goal reached
  - Success notification pattern: Streak milestone, achievement unlocked
  - Warning: Approaching budget limit, over-budget alert
- Transitions: Screens slide from right (push/pop navigation). Modals rise from bottom as draggable bottom sheets with a pill-shaped drag handle. List items enter with staggered fade-in animation (50ms delay between items).
</gestures_and_haptics>

<splash_screen>
The brand moment:

- Background: Emerald Primary (#10B981) full screen
- Center: ExpenseFlow logo — a minimalist, geometric money-flow icon in white
- Animation: Logo fades in (0 → 1 opacity, 600ms ease-out), then subtly scales up (1.0 → 1.05, 400ms spring), followed by a smooth transition to the next screen
- Bottom: "Made with ❤️ by tamadev © 2025" in white, 12px, Plus Jakarta Sans Medium, opacity 0.7
- Duration: 1.5 seconds total before auto-navigating to Onboarding (first launch) or Biometric Lock screen (returning user)
- No loading spinner. The splash IS the loading state.
</splash_screen>

<onboarding_flow>
The first 60 seconds hook — 3 swipeable slides:

Slide 1:
- Visual: Clean illustration of a smartphone with floating expense cards organizing themselves — subtle float animation (translateY oscillation)
- Headline: "Track Every Penny"
- Subtext: "Log expenses in under 5 seconds. Fast, simple, satisfying."

Slide 2:
- Visual: Illustration of colorful bar charts growing upward with a small trophy icon
- Headline: "See Where It Goes"
- Subtext: "Beautiful insights that make your spending crystal clear."

Slide 3:
- Visual: Illustration of a streak counter with badge icons and a subtle glow
- Headline: "Build Money Habits"
- Subtext: "Earn streaks and achievements. Consistency has never been this fun."

Interaction: Horizontal swipe with paging dots at bottom center. Each slide transitions with a smooth parallax effect (illustration moves slower than text).
CTA: On the final slide, a large full-width Emerald button at the bottom: "Get Started →" with soft glow on press. Minimum height: 56px. Bottom safe area respected.
Skip: Small "Skip" text link at top-right for returning users. Subtle, not distracting.
</onboarding_flow>

<login_register_screen>
Clean, trustworthy, fast:

- Layout: Top 40% — ExpenseFlow logo + tagline centered. Bottom 60% — auth options.
- Primary Auth: Large "Continue with Google" button (white card style, Google logo, full width). Below it: "Continue with Apple" button (black card style, Apple logo, full width).
- Divider: Subtle "or" divider line between OAuth and fallback.
- Fallback: "Continue with Email" text button for users without Google/Apple.
- After first login: Prompt to set up Biometric (Face ID / Fingerprint) with friendly copy: "Secure your finances with a glance 👁️" and a "Set Up Face ID" Emerald CTA button.
- PIN Setup: Secondary option — "Prefer a PIN instead?" link below biometric setup. 6-digit PIN with large circular input indicators.
- Legal: Tiny footer links — "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" in Text Secondary color.
- Animation: Auth buttons stagger in from bottom (100ms delay each). Logo has a subtle bounce on mount.

Network Status: Subtle top banner if offline: "You're offline — don't worry, everything saves locally 💾". Auto-dismiss when connection returns.
</global_interactions>

<motion_principles>
Mobile-first physics:

1. Response time < 100ms for all touch feedback (glow, highlight)
2. Micro-animations: 200-300ms (button press, icon morph, toggle switch)
3. Screen transitions: 300-400ms with spring physics (damping: 20, stiffness: 90)
4. Chart/progress animations: 500-800ms with easeOut curve, triggered on mount/visibility
5. Staggered list entrance: 50ms delay between items, fade + translateY(20px → 0)
6. Bottom sheet spring: overdamped spring for natural feel when sliding up
7. Skeleton shimmer: Continuous 1.5s loop, linear timing

Forbidden:
- Hover effects (Phone has no cursor!)
- Tiny links or text-only tap targets (Must be touchable areas ≥ 44x44px)
- Horizontal scroll inside vertical scroll without snap-to-item behavior
- Jarring opacity jumps (Always animate opacity transitions)
- Layout shifts after content loads (Skeleton prevents this)
- Scroll hijacking or custom scroll physics
- Autoplay videos or sounds without user consent

<quality_checklist>
Before this is complete, verify:
□ Are ALL touch targets ≥ 44x44px?
□ Is text readable outdoors (high contrast, minimum 16px body)?
□ Is navigation reachable with one thumb (bottom 60% of screen)?
□ Do ALL buttons provide visual glow feedback on press?
□ Are "Back" gestures intuitive (swipe from left edge)?
□ Is the bottom safe area (Home indicator) respected on all screens?
□ No "Hover" logic anywhere in the codebase?
□ Is Dark mode architecture prepared (color tokens, not hardcoded)?
□ Do skeleton screens match actual content layout?
□ Are list items virtualized for performance?
□ Does the FAB remain accessible on all scrollable screens?
□ Are haptics implemented for key interactions?
□ Is offline functionality fully working (local-first)?
□ Are financial amounts formatted with proper currency locale?
□ Do charts animate smoothly on mount?
□ Is biometric lock triggered on app background/foreground?
□ Are empty states designed with illustrations and CTAs?
□ Would this get featured on the App Store? Would Tim Cook smile?
